# Hydrating Face Masks — Simple Kitchen Recipes 🌿

Welcome — these are easy, hydrating face masks for **dry skin** you can make with common kitchen ingredients. No honey, no avocado, and no banana — just gentle, effective combos using yogurt, milk, oats, coffee and turmeric.

## Quick tips before you start
- Always apply to **clean, dry skin**.  
- **10–15 minutes** is usually perfect — don’t let the mask dry completely for longer than ~20 minutes.  
- Rinse with lukewarm water and pat dry, then follow with a moisturizer.  
- Turmeric can stain clothes and towels; rinse thoroughly. Use a clean face cloth.  
- If you have very sensitive skin, do a patch test on your inner wrist or jawline for 5–10 minutes.
